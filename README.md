# Fort Micromite
This is a game written in MMBasic for the Color Maximite 2 (CMM2)
It is work in progress but it is feature complete. Only balancing
and optimisation activities are missing.

The goal of the game is to enter the base of Dr.Evil with your helicopter
and destroy the base by blowing up the reactor which is deeply burried
in the mountain. While you fight against automatic defence robots,
lasers and try to manouver through the cave labyrinth, rescue the
workers who were held hostage to work for Dr. Evil.

This game was inspired by the old classic 'Fort Apocalypse' from the
C64 or Atari. It has been redeveloped from scratch including graphics,
sound effects and game mechanics.

The game can be played with a Nunchuk or with the keyboard
		    Nunchuk	Keyboard
    Controls	    joystick	cursor keys
    Fire	    Button z	Key 'a'

To change the orientation of the helicopter move the joystick in the
desired direction and hold it for 1-2 seconds until the helicopter
changed orientation.

To bord people just land close to them. After landing they will
start running towards the helicopter.

The Colour Maximite 2 is a small self contained computer inspired by
the home computers of the early 80's such as the Tandy TRS-80,
Commodore 64 and Apple II. (https://geoffg.net/maximite.html)
